COCO: Hey you! Tin can! I thought I told you to get lost.
COCO: This is Rampage territory, you hear?
THE CURRENT: Who’s this Rampage? We didn’t see any signs.
COCO: Only the coolest, most dangerous goat gang this side of the wasteland.
COCO: We’re not accepting new members, so don’t even ask.
RATTLES: WHIR-WHIR…
COCO: Anyway, you lame-o’s better be useful if you wanna get on our good side.
COCO: Where’s the Forest of Plenty? And you better not lie to me.
THE CURRENT: I’m afraid we have no clue what you’re talking about.
COCO: Were you born yesterday or something?
RATTLES: …RATTLE?
THE CURRENT: Something like that.
COCO: Figures. Anyway, there’s this legend going around about a forest with trees as far as the eye can see.
COCO: Once I find it, the Rampage is totally gonna corner the lumber market. We’ll be the richest goats in town.
THE CURRENT: Can’t help you with that, I’m afraid. But, uh… good luck?
COCO: Hmph. Didn’t need you losers’ help anyway. I’ll find it on my own.
COCO: You better not cross the Rams again, bros. I mean it.
