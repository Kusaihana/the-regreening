BARD: Hm. You are a functioning human-built robot.
RATTLES: RATTLE-WHIR.
BARD: A fascinating discovery for a roboticist or an archeologist.
BARD: Unfortunately, I am neither. 
BARD: So I must ask you to step away before you interfere with my thesis.
THE CURRENT: Oh! Sorry about that. What is your thesis, if we may ask?
BARD: A spiritual manifestation too, I see. How fortunate for a parapsychologist.
BARD: I am conducting a study of the water content in soil samples in this wasteland.
BARD: I am aiming to prove my pet theory about natural water retention.
RATTLES: WHIR-WHIR?
BARD: I need to demonstrate that using berms and rocks has a net positive effect on the water content of the soil.
BARD: In fact, I am certain of it. But my academic advisor demands proof.
BARD: Hence why I’m here, and not at the Athenaeum writing my paper.
BARD: Perhaps you’d be willing to assist me in my research?
THE CURRENT: Berms and rocks, you say? We’ll see what we can do.
BARD: Yes. That would be of great help to me.
BARD: Okay. I’m going back to measuring samples now.
