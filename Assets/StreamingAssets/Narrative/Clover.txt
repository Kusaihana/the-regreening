CLOVER THE DEER: This must be the place.
CLOVER THE DEER: Unless… it was somewhere else?
CLOVER THE DEER: Everything looks the same these days.
RATTLES: RATTLE-RATTLE.
CLOVER THE DEER: DON’T COME NEAR ME!!
CLOVER THE DEER: I'll fight both of you if I need to!
THE CURRENT: We mean no harm!
THE CURRENT: We saw you and just wanted to say hi.
CLOVER THE DEER: No one here just says hi.
CLOVER THE DEER: But you two don’t seem to know much about life here anyway.
CLOVER THE DEER: In any case, I’m looking for something, so don't get in the way.
THE CURRENT: Can we help?
CLOVER THE DEER: I need no help. I don’t even know if it was here…
RATTLES: RATTLE-RATTLE.
CLOVER THE DEER: Easy for you to say, you’re tall!
CLOVER THE DEER: Aha! Found it!
CLOVER THE DEER: …
CLOVER THE DEER: Well, I thought this one had a chance. But it died, too.
THE CURRENT: Wait! You’re planting the seeds!
CLOVER THE DEER: All in vain. They never make it.
THE CURRENT: Rattles, let’s bring some water for the plants and see if this helps.
CLOVER THE DEER: Good luck with that. I’ll stay.
CLOVER THE DEER: Deep in my plant sorrow.
