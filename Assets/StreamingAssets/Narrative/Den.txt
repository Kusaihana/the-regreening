DEN: Darn it to bits!
DEN: Now you’ve gone and scared it off with yer rattlin’.
RATTLES: RATTLE-RATTLE…
THE CURRENT: My partner and I sincerely apologize.
THE CURRENT: Whom or what did we scare off?
DEN: The darn chipmunk!
THE CURRENT: Oh! We didn’t see any chipmunks around here.
DEN: They hide in their little holes. They don’t come out during the day.
DEN: Neither do I, for the matter. Not usually. But I’m gettin’ a bit desperate.
THE CURRENT: You’re a hunter, I gather?
DEN: Supposed to be. Haven’t caught nothin’ in a while, though.
DEN: Not a lot of prey around these parts. 
DEN: This here used to be a forest clearing… My clan would always come here to hunt.
RATTLES: WHIR-RATTLE?
THE CURRENT: That’s a brilliant idea! Let’s plant some oak seeds around here.
THE CURRENT: Once the tree cover returns, this will be a better place for prey and predators alike.
THE CURRENT: Plus, it’s the least we could do for scaring off your lunch.
DEN: It’s not just me. I got little-uns back home. But sure, that sounds fair.
DEN: Now pardon me, but I gotta set up another snare.
DEN: Go quietly.
