  description: Quercus robur is a species of flowering plant in the beech and oak
    family, Fagaceae.  Quercus robur is a deciduous tree up to 40 m tall, with a
    single stout trunk that can be as much as 11 m in girth (circumference at breast
    height) or even 14 m in pollarded specimens.
  distribution: It is a large tree, native to most of Europe and western Asia, and
    is widely cultivated in other temperate regions.  It grows on soils of near neutral
    acidity in the lowlands and is notable for its value to natural ecosystems, supporting
    a very wide diversity of herbivorous insects and other pests, predators and pathogens
