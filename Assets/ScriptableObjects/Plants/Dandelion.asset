  description: Taraxacum officinale is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant in
    the daisy family Asteraceae (syn. Compositae). The common dandelion is well known
    for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of many silver-tufted
    fruits that disperse in the wind. These balls are called "clocks" in both British
    and American English.
  distribution: Originally being native to Eurasia, but can also be found across
    the Americas, southern Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand as a result of
    incidental or deliberate introductions.  The common dandelion grows in temperate
    regions of the world in areas with moist soils. They are very hardy plants, able
    to grow in a variety of environments, and are tolerant of crowding, extremes
    of temperature, and low moisture.
